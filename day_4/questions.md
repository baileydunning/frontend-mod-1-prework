## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

**The basic purpose of a function is to make things easier on yourself in the long run & organize your code.**
*They are used to group statements together to run a specific set of code.
So in cases where you may need to run that code multiple times, a function is a much more efficient way of achieving that than a standard variable*

1. What is a parameter?

**Parameters are variables that describe the function**

1. What is a return value?

**Return statements end the function**

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

function hello() {
  return "Sam I am";
};

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

function hello_someone(name) {
  var name = "Bailey"
  return "I am " + name;
};

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?

console.log(hello_someone());

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?

*None at the moment
