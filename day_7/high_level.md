## Checker Board

Write a program that will log a checkerboard based on the size *indicated by the user*.  On this board, the black spaces will be represented with 'X' and the white spaces will be represented with ' '

+ Create a `checkerBoard` object that stores width & height
+ Create a function `buildBoard` that takes an argument of dimensions (log width * height)
+ Declare variables for blackSpace ("X") & whiteSpace (" ")
+ Create a loop that logs the width value as (blackSpace + whiteSpace) * (variable width)
+ Make the height value equal the number of times the width value logs
+ Create a new variable with the user's dimensions
+ Log the new variable to display the checker board
